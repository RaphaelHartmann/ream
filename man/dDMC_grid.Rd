\usage{
dDMC_grid(
  rt_max = 10,
  phi = c(0.3, 0.5, -1, 0.2, 0.05, 2.5, 3, 1, 0.5, 0, 0, 1),
  x_res = "default",
  t_res = "default"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rt_max}{maximal response time <- max(rt)}

\item{phi}{parameter vector in the following order:
\itemize{
\item Non-decision time (\eqn{t_{nd}}). Time for non-decision processes such as stimulus
encoding and response execution. Total decision time t is the sum of the decision
and non-decision times.
\item Relative start (\eqn{w}). Sets the start point of accumulation as a ratio of
the two decision thresholds. Related to the absolute start z point via equation
\eqn{z = b_l + w*(b_u - b_l)}.
\item Coherence parameter (\eqn{s}). Sets stimulus coherence. If \eqn{s = 1}, coherent condition;
if \eqn{s = 0}, neutral condition; if \eqn{s = -1}, incoherent condition.
\item Automatic process amplitude (\eqn{A}). Max value of automatic process.
\item Scale parameter (\eqn{\tau}). Contributes to time automatic process. Time to max
\eqn{t_max = (a – 1)*\tau}.
    \item Shape parameter (\eqn{a}). Indicates the shape of the automatic process. Must
have value more than 1 (\eqn{a > 1}).
\item Drift rate of the controlled process (\eqn{\mu_c}).
\item Noise scale (\eqn{\sigma}). Model noise scale parameter.
\item Decision thresholds (\eqn{b}). Sets the location of each decision threshold. The
upper threshold \eqn{b_u} is above 0 and the lower threshold \eqn{b_l} is below 0 such that
\eqn{b_u = -b_l = b}. The threshold separation \eqn{a = 2b}.
\item Contamination (\eqn{g}). Sets the strength of the contamination process. Contamination
process is a uniform distribution \eqn{f_c(t)} where \eqn{f_c(t) = 1/(g_u-g_l)}
if \eqn{g_l <= t <= g_u} and \eqn{f_c(t) = 0} if \eqn{t < g_l} or \eqn{t > g_u}. It is
combined with PDF \eqn{f_i(t)} to give the final combined distribution
\eqn{f_{i,c}(t) = g*f_c(t) + (1-g)*f_i(t)}, which is then output by the program.
If \eqn{g = 0}, it just outputs \eqn{f_i(t)}.
\item Lower bound of contamination distribution (\eqn{g_l}). See parameter \eqn{g}.
\item Upper bound of contamination distribution (\eqn{g_u}). See parameter \eqn{g}.
