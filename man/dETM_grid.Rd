\title{Generate Grid for PDF of the Exponential Threshold Model}
\usage{
dETM_grid(
  rt_max = 10,
  phi = c(0.3, 0.5, 1, 1, 1.5, 0.5, 0, 0, 1),
  x_res = "default",
  t_res = "default"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rt_max}{maximal response time <- max(rt)}

\item{phi}{parameter vector in the following order:
\itemize{
\item Non-decision time (\eqn{t_{nd}}). Time for non-decision processes such as stimulus
encoding and response execution. Total decision time t is the sum of the decision
and non-decision times.
\item Relative start (\eqn{w}). Sets the start point of accumulation as a ratio of
the two decision thresholds. Related to the absolute start z point via equation
\eqn{z = b_l + w*(b_u - b_l)}.
\item Stimulus strength (\eqn{\mu}). Strength of the stimulus and used to set the drift
rate. For changing threshold models \eqn{v(x,t) = \mu}.
\item Noise scale (\eqn{\sigma}). Model noise scale parameter.
\item Initial decision threshold location (\eqn{b_0}). Sets the location of each decision
threshold at time \eqn{t = 0}.
\item Rate of threshold change (\eqn{\tau}).
\item Contamination (\eqn{g}). Sets the strength of the contamination process. Contamination
process is a uniform distribution \eqn{f_c(t)} where \eqn{f_c(t) = 1/(g_u-g_l)}
if \eqn{g_l <= t <= g_u} and \eqn{f_c(t) = 0} if \eqn{t < g_l} or \eqn{t > g_u}. It is
combined with PDF \eqn{f_i(t)} to give the final combined distribution
\eqn{f_{i,c}(t) = g*f_c(t) + (1-g)*f_i(t)}, which is then output by the program.
If \eqn{g = 0}, it just outputs \eqn{f_i(t)}.
\item Lower bound of contamination distribution (\eqn{g_l}). See parameter \eqn{g}.
\item Upper bound of contamination distribution (\eqn{g_u}). See parameter \eqn{g}.
