\title{Generate Grid for PDF of the Urgency Gating Model With Flip}
\usage{
dUGMF_grid(
  rt_max = 10,
  phi = c(0.3, 0.5, 1, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 0, 0, 1),
  x_res = "default",
  t_res = "default"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rt_max}{maximal response time <- max(rt)}

\item{phi}{parameter vector in the following order:
\itemize{
\item Non-decision time (\eqn{t_{nd}}). Time for non-decision processes such as stimulus
encoding and response execution. Total decision time t is the sum of the decision
and non-decision times.
\item Relative start (\eqn{w}). Sets the start point of accumulation as a ratio of
the two decision thresholds. Related to the absolute start z point via equation
\eqn{z = b_l + w*(b_u - b_l)}.
\item Stimulus strength (\eqn{E_0}). Strength of the stimulus.
\item Leakage (\eqn{L}). Rate of leaky integration.
\item Urgency (\eqn{k}). Decision urgency. If \eqn{k} is small, the choice is dominated by
leakage and approximates a LM. If \eqn{k} is large, it is an urgency dominated decision.
\item ????????? \eqn{t0}
\item Noise scale (\eqn{\sigma}). Model scaling parameter.
\item Decision thresholds (\eqn{b}). Sets the location of each decision threshold. The
upper threshold \eqn{b_u} is above 0 and the lower threshold \eqn{b_l} is below 0 such that
\eqn{b_u = -b_l = b}. The threshold separation \eqn{a = 2b}.
\item Contamination (\eqn{g}). Sets the strength of the contamination process. Contamination
process is a uniform distribution \eqn{f_c(t)} where \eqn{f_c(t) = 1/(g_u-g_l)}
if \eqn{g_l <= t <= g_u} and \eqn{f_c(t) = 0} if \eqn{t < g_l} or \eqn{t > g_u}. It is
combined with PDF \eqn{f_i(t)} to give the final combined distribution
\eqn{f_{i,c}(t) = g*f_c(t) + (1-g)*f_i(t)}, which is then output by the program.
If \eqn{g = 0}, it just outputs \eqn{f_i(t)}.
\item Lower bound of contamination distribution (\eqn{g_l}). See parameter \eqn{g}.
\item Upper bound of contamination distribution (\eqn{g_u}). See parameter \eqn{g}.
